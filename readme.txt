Displays guitar chords and tab into posts and pages using clean SVG vector graphics, based on the jTab JavaScript library by Paul Gallagher.
 
== Description ==
jTab Guitar Tab Shortcode displays clean SVG graphics of guitar chords and tab on your WordPress blog, based on simple text notation entered into a WordPress shortcode. 
This plugin is based on the excellent open-source jTab JavaScript library by Paul Gallagher (http://jtab.tardate.com). "jTab is a javascript-based library that renders notation using CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG). It works in most modern browsers that support javascript, CSS and scalable vector graphics (SVG)."
